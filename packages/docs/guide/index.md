# Get Started

## What is this?

This package is a `Vue` component that can be given a string of markdown that itâ€™ll safely render to Vue elements.


You can pass plugins to change how markdown is transformed and pass components that will be used instead of normal HTML elements.

* to learn markdown, see this [cheatsheet and tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/)

::: tip
This package was inspired by [react-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown), and the implementation ideas can be referenced from the [GitHub](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#architecture).
